QueMar Quefrency rev2 Keyboard Case
=======================

Case design file for the [Quefrency rev2](https://keeb.io/products/quefrency-rev-2-60-65-split-staggered-keyboard). 

### Switch Plate

Switch plate is 3mm thick to reduce flex in the final assembly. I found that with this width, no PCB support from the base plate is needed, it's plenty enough rigid.
Two versions of the switch plate are available, one matches the default design from [Keebio's Github](https://github.com/keebio/quefrency-case/tree/master/rev2) and the other has the leftmost notch in the space bar area of the left hand removes. I removed it as some layouts don't need it and it causes a miss-alignment of the 1.25 switch placed there.
